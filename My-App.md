# Planning the App

## Main screen
- Most of these panic applications require too many steps to reach an exercise meant to calm someone down during a panic attack. This is not good design users who are experiencing an attack need the minimum number of taps possible to access a breathing exercise since movement during one of these attacks is difficult. I only want 2 taps to access the sequence, one to open the app and another to start the sequence. At the top of the home screen there will be a large button that states “I am having an attack”. This will run through a simulation of breathing (with an animation, voice over, and text) with the option to pause and start the exercise at any point. At the end of the exercise there will be options to further complete a grounding exercise, body awareness exercise, or to repeat the breathing exercise. Studies have shown that a calming voice has the best impact, but it is also important to have text in case users want to be discrete and do not have headphones.
- At the bottom of the home screen there will be the option to “track your daily mood” and write an entry associated with this mood. Entry form will have a ranking of panic the user might seek, the scale of the impact, a section to write an entry of any length, and associated symptoms. For example, you can have panic without depression and depression without panic. 

## Navigation bar


## Journal screen
- Default screen will be a chart tracking the overall mood of the patient over time with the options to display mood, or symptom specific categories.
