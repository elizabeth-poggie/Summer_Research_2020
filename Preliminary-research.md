# Preliminary Research

## Panic Attack Mitigation

### Psychoeducation

Efficacy has not been tested in controlled studies


### Lifestyle Management

Reduce caffeine intake

Relaxation techniques:
- Taught by tapes / CDs [1]
- Although not as effective as behavioural and cognitive therapies 

Exercise:
- Expose patients to increased heart rate and shortness of breath
- Efficacy has not been studied in controlled studies [1]

Stress Management:
- Efficacy has not been studied in control studies [1]


### Drugs 

Some studies suggest that drugs should be taken with psychotherapy. Better short-term outcomes / helps the end of drug usage / prevents relapse [1] 

Patients with depression have higher rates of drug relapsing / withdrawing. [1]

Withdrawing drugs during psychotherapy results in patients attributing recovery to the therapy as apposed to drug usage [1]


### Behavioural Therapy

Fear Habituation:
- Exposure to experience or encounter their feared situations or sensations under conditions of perceived safety. [1]

Retraining in Breathing: 
- slower / deeper / regularly
- Regular feature of most treatments [1]
- Efficacy of this task has not been studied in control studies 

General Efficacy of Behavioural Therapy:
- Brief cognitive behaviour therapy (6 – 8 hours) via cellular devices relieved panic attacks for most patients and was more effective then longer treatments. [2]
- NICD recommends 14 hours of cognitive behaviour therapy in weekly sessions of 1 – 2 hours to be completed within 4 months. [1] Although there is other research that suggests that daily 4?h sessions in week 1, two 2?h sessions in week 2 and one 2?h session in week 3 was just as effective at mediating panic disorders. [7] 
- Although it must be noted that CBT is much less effective for severe cases [4] 


### Internet’s Role

NICE recommends “FearFighter” for the management of panic and phobia. 

General efficacy of internet CBT: 
Stress management material confers short?term advantages but is not associated with any long-term improvements on panic severity and related cognitions, negative affect, general wellbeing and end?state functioning. [5] Although, this might have more to do with the fact that most patients relapse regardless of remote or in-person treatment. 


### Relapse 

Most patients relapse. This can be discouraging as this results in patients returning to destructive behaviour (avoidance of fear / catastrophic thoughts) [1]


### Relapse Tasks

Xxx


### Cognitive Behavioural Therapy Tasks

Treatment that included interoceptive exposure was more effective at post?treatment in terms of panic frequency, overall severity and functioning, and more effective at six?month follow?up in terms of panic frequency, phobic fears and general anxiety and functioning. [6]


## Anxiety Mitigation 

Uncertainty about possible future threats disrupts our ability to mitigate negative impacts [3].


### Important Questions this paper can further research

Which is more effective: drugs or behavioural therapy or other alternative therapies.

How can comorbid conditions (such as depression and substance misuse) affect the outcome and how should these conditions be treated [1]


### General Ideas for further Panic Specific Research

“FearFighter” has a very low rating on the App store. I could investigate why the application is recommended by NICE, but also research complaints of the users to search for areas of improvement.

By targeting not just Panic, but also comorbid behaviours such as depression and anxiety should improve the user experience. I can further investigate this with experts in the field.

Since most patients relapse, I can investigate the sorts of tasks patients need to deal with relapse and introduce them into later stages of the application’s usage.
