# Preliminary Research - Panic Attack Mitigation

## Psychoeducation

Efficacy has not been tested in controlled studies


## Lifestyle Management

Reduce caffeine intake

Relaxation techniques:
- Taught by tapes / CDs [1]
- Although not as effective as behavioural and cognitive therapies 

Exercise:
- Expose patients to increased heart rate and shortness of breath
- Efficacy has not been studied in controlled studies [1]

Stress Management:
- Efficacy has not been studied in control studies [1]


## Drugs 

Some studies suggest that drugs should be taken with psychotherapy. Better short-term outcomes / helps the end of drug usage / prevents relapse [1] 

Patients with depression have higher rates of drug relapsing / withdrawing. [1]

Withdrawing drugs during psychotherapy results in patients attributing recovery to the therapy as apposed to drug usage [1]


## Behavioural Therapy

Fear Habituation:
- Exposure to experience or encounter their feared situations or sensations under conditions of perceived safety. [1]

Retraining in Breathing: 
- slower / deeper / regularly
- Regular feature of most treatments [1]
- Efficacy of this task has not been studied in control studies 

General Efficacy of Behavioural Therapy:
- Brief cognitive behaviour therapy (6 – 8 hours) via cellular devices relieved panic attacks for most patients and was more effective then longer treatments. [2]
- NICD recommends 14 hours of cognitive behaviour therapy in weekly sessions of 1 – 2 hours to be completed within 4 months. [1] Although there is other research that suggests that daily 4hr sessions in week 1, two 2hr sessions in week 2 and one 2hr session in week 3 was just as effective at mediating panic disorders. [7] 
- It must be noted that CBT is much less effective for severe cases [4] 


## Cognitive Behavioural Therapy Tasks

Treatment that included interoceptive exposure was more effective at post-treatment in terms of panic frequency, overall severity and functioning, and more effective at six-month follow-up in terms of panic frequency, phobic fears and general anxiety and functioning. [6]


## Relapse 

Most patients relapse. This can be discouraging as this results in patients returning to destructive behaviour (avoidance of fear / catastrophic thoughts) [1]


## Important Questions this paper can further research

Which is more effective: drugs or behavioural therapy or other alternative therapies.

How can comorbid conditions (such as depression and substance misuse) affect the outcome and how should these conditions be treated [1]


## Comorbidity

### Anxiety:

Uncertainty about possible future threats disrupts our ability to mitigate negative impacts [3]. This is comorbid with panic disorders [1].

### Depression:

## Internet’s Role and where I come in

The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence’s (NICE) recommends “FearFighter” for the management of panic and phobia. [1] Although on the App store this application has a 1.5 star rating. Some notable comments are [9]:
- “This is a tool that is paid for with a government contract. They also portray that they are here to help employees. I downloaded the app on my iPad and it had some display issues in the first section. Then, after putting time aside to part two, it kept playing the SAME video over and over again. I gave up and went to their website to use the online version. At the place where it said, “Click to play”, it did nothing. What a bad joke to tell employees, “We’re here to help” and provide broken apps and a broken website.” Amdavis, 05/05/2020
- “I’m stuck on a module and the app keeps quitting. I’ve deleted the app and logged out and logged back in, same problems. The content, as far as I have gotten, seems to be helpful, but the app function is terrible, which is why it’s a 1 Star review” 
aviboy97, 07/12/2019
- “Useless The app crashes after watching the videos at 75% progression in Module 3. I cannot continue further, so I am uninstalling the app and seeking help elsewhere. What a huge waste of time.” CryoDrago, 05/31/2019
- “VCS code provided by their website to access the app just pops up an error saying something went wrong, try again. The support on their website had no idea what the app was and recommended I look for a help option on their website - um, that’s how I contacted you in the first place? Their is also a web version of the app and that doesn’t even launch.” BenSS, 05/07/2019

There are no reviews on the play store for android. 
 
The General efficacy of internet CBT for panic is non-optimal. Stress management material confers short-term advantages but is not associated with any long-term improvements on panic severity and related cognitions, negative affect, general wellbeing and end-state functioning. [5] Although, this might have more to do with the fact that most patients relapse regardless of remote or in-person treatment with regards to panic. 

Cambridge found some examples of computerized therapy for depression and anxiety in 2018 that led to greater satisfaction with treatment long afterwards. [8] 

## General plan of action

A plan of action for my application could be to target CBT with regards to panic in the short-term since this has the best short-term outcome (call this part 1) and then target comorbid behaviours such as depression and anxiety in the long run to prevent relapse. (part 2) SEE IF THIS IS A GOOD IDEA BY ASKING A PROFESSIONAL

### For part 1: 

Despite the lack of user experience, FearFighter was proven clinically to reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression, and panic [9]. With this in mind, I can try to understand what the application was doing right to generate these results and by focusing on user experience, I can mitigate the downsides 

### For part 2: 

For the Cambridge study they ran their 



### General Ideas for further Panic Specific Research

Since most patients relapse, I can investigate the sorts of tasks patients need to deal with relapse and introduce them into later stages of the application’s usage.
