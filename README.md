# Summer Research 2020 Overview

COMP 400 Research project under Joseph Vybihal for the summer 2020 academic term. The Goal is to make a cross-platform opensource application for panic mitigation with cognitive behavioural tasks (CBT) that are clinically effective. Due to recent circumstances, the target audience for this application are those living in isolation and do not have access to proper psychological help. 

COMP-400 is 4 credits, amounting to ~160 hours of work that will be spread out over the course of the summer. 

# Plan of Action

1. Preliminary research on Cognitive behavioural therapy for panic, anxiety, and depression. 
2. Come up with a 2-5 page proposal for Vybihal to determine the best course of action for the summer. Proposal will contain hardware, software, research tools, tentative schedule used in the project. This will also contain the result/outcome that is considered a success.
3. Code and demo the application progress to Vybihal on a semi-regular basis. 
4. Make a final report that is 10 to 20 pages long. This will follow the typical style of a research paper: introduction (high-level background, motivation), background (what the reader needs to know to understand the remaining content of the report), your contribution (overview, details), related work (work of others that is similar), conclusions and future work (summary, what worked and what did not, what remains to be done, how the project can be improved/expanded). Optional: add appendices (e.g. with details of proofs, algorithms, code) if appropriate.
