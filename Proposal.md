# Proposal

## Introduction 

Panic treatment online has a shockingly low presence despite being shown as an effective treatment measure. The few applications that do exist all have low ratings yet still manage to be government recommended. Mental health applications that are successful primarily focus on anxiety and depression, but not on Panic. Additionally, some of these applications are expensive and some are not cross-platform. 

My goal is to develop an opensource cross-platform application for panic mitigation. 

The issue with treating panic is that most patients relapse just after 3 months post initial treatment. Some studies have shown that cognitive behavioural tasks (CBT) can be effective in the short term when dealing with acute panic, but never in long run. There is only a limited selection of activities that have an impact 6-month post treatment. Consequently, my application will be split into 2 parts where panic is targeted in the short-term, but the comorbid behaviours are focused in the long-term. 

The main question my application will be trying to answer is that when it comes to treating a panic disorder, how should comorbid conditions be treated and how can this can affect the patient’s overall success in the long run. Comorbid behaviours strongly linked to panic are anxiety and depression. Some studies have even gone as far to show that there are higher rates of suicide attempts among those that struggle with a panic disorder.  


## For part 1: 

I would take inspiration from The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence’s recommended panic and phobia application “FearFighter”. Although, this application has 1.5 stars on the App store and no ratings on the play store. Despite the lack of user experience, FearFighter has been proven clinically to reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression, and panic [9]. With this in mind, I can try to understand what the application is doing right to generate these positive results and by focusing on user experience, I can mitigate the downsides associated with this very low rating. 

I will also take inspiration on the recommended applications by the Anxiety and Depression Society of America. They recommend 2 applications which generally target anxiety and have some panic mitigation features. Although, these applications have not been shown clinically to have an impact on overall patient success in panic mitigation and have been criticized by psychologists for not being useful in dealing with acute attacks.   

Finally, I can incorporate CBT activities with associated long-term improvement for panic treatment (such as interoceptive exposure).

## For part 2: 

Cambridge found some examples of computerized therapy for depression and anxiety in 2018 that led to greater satisfaction with treatment long afterwards. They ran their study on the efficacy with the web application “Beating the Blues” which is an interactive CBT package. The general way for how the program works can be found on their website as well as many papers published showing the efficacy of this online treatment. Additionally, McGill recommends a selection of IOS and Android applications for targeting depression or anxiety. Although, it must be noted that McGill’s recommended applications are all free whereas Beating the Blues is 100 euros (153 CAD). They have recently discounted the application since Covid-19 to be 20 euros (31 CAD). 

I can investigate the overlap that “Beating the Blues” has with the McGill recommended applications in order to create something with the best possible user experience while also ensuring that the choices of tasks for the application have been proven to be clinically effective. 


## What I’m doing this Weekend

Downloading every recommended application for panic, depression, and anxiety and comparing their similarities, strengths, and downsides while ensuring all the tasks that are being used are clinically significant. As well, I need to investigate other tasks that are proven successful which are not apparent in any of these applications. 

Total potential cost: 50 CAD


## Software I will use

React native as this is compatible with IOS and Android so getting help is not dependent on the operating system.

These are some visually appealing libraries that I can incorporate to add the user experience because a huge issue with a lot of these mental health applications is that they are not interactive. Some just show the user a video clip or just give quizzes. Some examples of libraries are: 
- Three.js can be used to create and display interactive animated 3D graphics. 
- p5.js is used for creative coding and making simple animations. 
- D3.js can be used for manipulating documents based on data. Not sure how this can fit into the application but might have some insights after exploring all these other applications that already exist. 


## Research tools 

JSTOR and Google Scholar are my best friends right now. As well as all the reviews on the App and Play store. I am in the process of trying to find someone who is knowledgeable in this area of research. 


## Tentative schedule 

*Week 1: May 11 – May 15:* 
Preliminary research and emailing another expert in the field about this idea. 

*Week 2: May 18 – May 22:* 
Investigating and formalizing the specific tasks of focus for the application. 

*Week 3: May 25 – May 29:*
Coding can start. Make a skeleton for the application. I have some experience in react but have never dealt with react native before.  

*Week 4: June 1 – June 5:* 
My internship officially starts. Might be delayed this week with the schedule. 

*Week 6: June 8 – June 12:*
Code.

*Week 7: June 15 – June 19:*
Code. 

*Week 8: June 22 – June 26:*
Code. 

*Week 9: June 29 – July 3:* 
I move out this week to some unknown location. Will be delayed this week with the schedule. 

*Week 10: July 6 – July 10:*
Code. 

*Week 13: July 13 – July 17:*
Code. Start final report. 

*Week 14: July 20 – July 24:* 
Code and final report. 

*Week 15: July 27 – August 1:*
code and final report. 

*Week 16: August 3 – August 7:*
Finalize code and final report.  

*Week 17: August 10 – August 14:*
The summer semester examination period is this week. Submit code and final report?  


## Goal

To make a cross-platform opensource application for panic mitigation with cognitive behavioural tasks (CBT) that are clinically effective. 


## Future Work

Just because the tasks I am using are clinically significant does not mean it makes a difference. I would need to test this with many users to see where the application is lacking in a standardized way. 


## Unintended Consequences of this Research

The only advertisements I am getting nowadays are self help applications and online counselling options.
