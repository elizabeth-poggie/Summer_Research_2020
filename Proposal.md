# Proposal

## Introduction 

A huge question when it comes to treating a panic disorder is how comorbid conditions should be treated and how this can affect the patient’s overall success in the long-term. Comorbid behaviours strongly linked to panic are anxiety and depression. Some studies have even gone as far to state that there are higher rates of suicide attempts among those that struggle with a panic disorder.  

Now the issue with treating a panic disorder is that most patients relapse just after 3 months from initial treatment. Studies have shown that cognitive behavioural tasks (CBT) can be effective in the short term when dealing with acute attacks, but never long term. Only some specific activities have been shown to have some impact 6-month post treatment, but studies on this are limited and requires further investigation.  

Consequently, my application will be split into 2 parts to not only target in mitigating panic, but the comorbid behaviours as well. 

## For part 1: 

Despite the lack of user experience, FearFighter was proven clinically to reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression, and panic [9]. With this in mind, I can try to understand what the application was doing right to generate these results and by focusing on user experience, I can mitigate the downsides 

## For part 2: 

For the Cambridge study they ran their study on the efficacy with the web application “Beating the Blues” which is an interactive CBT package and 8 therapy sessions lasting 50 minutes along with ‘homework’ projects for each session. The general way for how the program works can be found here in addition to a bunch of papers published about the efficacy of online treatment of depression with this application. https://www.beatingtheblues.co.uk/how-it-works/#program [10]
