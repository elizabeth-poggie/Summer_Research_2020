# Proposal

## Introduction 

Panic treatment online has a shockingly low presence. The few applications that exist, which are government recommended, have low ratings. Applications which are more successful in dealing with mental health are targeting anxiety and depression and not focusing as much on Panic. Another issue with a lot of these applications is that some are expensive, and some are not cross platform. 

My goal is to develop a good opensource application for panic mitigation. 

A huge question when it comes to treating a panic disorder is how comorbid conditions should be treated and how this can affect the patient’s overall success in the long-term. Comorbid behaviours strongly linked to panic are anxiety and depression. Some studies have even gone as far to state that there are higher rates of suicide attempts among those that struggle with a panic disorder.  

The issue with treating a panic disorder is that most patients relapse just after 3 months post initial treatment. Studies have shown that cognitive behavioural tasks (CBT) can be effective in the short term when dealing with acute panic, but never long term. Only a limited selection of activities have some impact 6-month post treatment. Consequently, my application will be split into 2 parts where panic is targeted in the short term, but the comorbid behaviours are focused in the long term. 


## For part 1: 

I would take inspiration from The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence’s recommended panic and phobia application “FearFighter”. Although, this application has 1.5 stars on the App store and no ratings on the play store. Despite the lack of user experience, FearFighter has been proven clinically to reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression, and panic [9]. With this in mind, I can try to understand what the application is doing right to generate these positive results and by focusing on user experience, I can mitigate the downsides associated with this very low rating. 

I will also take inspiration on the recommended applications by the Anxiety and Depression Society of America. They recommend 2 applications which generally target anxiety but do have panic mitigation features. Although, these applications have not been shown clinically to have an impact on overall patient success in panic mitigation and have been criticized by psychologists at not being useful in dealing with an acute attack.   

Finally, I can incorporate CBT activities with associated long-term improvement for panic treatment (such as interoceptive exposure).

## For part 2: 

Cambridge found some examples of computerized therapy for depression and anxiety in 2018 that led to greater satisfaction with treatment long afterwards. They ran their study on the efficacy with the web application “Beating the Blues” which is an interactive CBT package and 8 therapy sessions lasting 50 minutes. The general way for how the program works can be found on their website as well as many papers published about the efficacy of this online treatment. Additionally, McGill recommends a selection of IOS and Android applications for targeting depression or anxiety. 

I can investigate the overlap that “Beating the Blues” has with the McGill recommended applications in order to create something with the pest possible user experience while also ensuring that the choices of tasks for the application have been proven to be clinically effective. 

It also should be noted that the McGill recommended applications are all free whereas Beating the Blues is 100 euros (153 CAD). They have recently discounted the application since Covid-19 to be 20 euros (31 CAD). 

## What I’m doing this Weekend

Downloading every recommended application for panic, depression, and anxiety and comparing their similarities, strengths, and downsides while ensuring all the tasks they are being used are clinically significant. As well, I need to investigate other tasks that are proven successful but are not apparent in any of these applications. 

Total potential cost: 50 CAD

## Software I will use

React native as this is compatible with IOS and Android so getting help is not dependent on the operating system.


## Research tools 

JSTOR and Google Scholar are my best friends right now. As well as all the reviews on the App and Play store. 


## Tentative schedule 

Week 1: May 11 – May 15: 
Preliminary research. 

Week 2: May 18 – May 22: 
Investigating and formalizing the specific tasks of focus for the application. 

Week 3: May 25 – May 29:
Coding can start. Make a skeleton for the application. I have some experience in react but have never dealt with react native before.  

Week 4: June 1 – June 5: 
My internship officially starts. Might be delayed this week with the schedule. 

Week 6: June 8 – June 12:
Code.

Week 7: June 15 – June 19:
Code. 

Week 8: June 22 – June 26:
Code. 

Week 9: June 29 – July 3: 
I move out this week to some unknown location. Will be delayed this week with the schedule. 

Week 10: July 6 – July 10:
Code. 

Week 13: July 13 – July 17:
Code. Start final report. 

Week 14: July 20 – July 24: 
Code and final report. 

Week 15: July 27 – August 1:
code and final report. 

Week 16: August 3 – August 7:
Finalize code and final report.  

Wek 17: August 10 – August 14:
The summer semester examination period is this week. Submit code and final report.  


## Goal

To make a functional opensource application for panic mitigation. 


## Future Work

Just because all the tasks I am looking at are clinically significant, this does not mean 


## Unintended Consequences of this Research

The only advertisements I am getting nowadays are self help applications and online counselling options.
