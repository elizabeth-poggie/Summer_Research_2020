## Introduction 

Panic treatment online has a shockingly low presence. The few applications that exist, which are government recommended, have the lowest reviews I’ve ever seen on an application. Applications which are more successful in dealing with mental health are more generally targeting anxiety and depression and not focusing as much on Panic. 

My goal is to develop a good application for panic mitigation. 

Although, a huge question when it comes to treating a panic disorder is how comorbid conditions should be treated and how this can affect the patient’s overall success in the long-term. Comorbid behaviours strongly linked to panic are anxiety and depression. Some studies have even gone as far to state that there are higher rates of suicide attempts among those that struggle with a panic disorder.  

The issue with treating a panic disorder is that most patients relapse just after 3 months post initial treatment. Studies have shown that cognitive behavioural tasks (CBT) can be effective in the short term when dealing with acute panic, but never long term. Only a limited selection of activities have some impact 6-month post treatment. Consequently, my application will be split into 2 parts where panic is targeted in the short term, but the comorbid behaviours are focused in the long term. 

## For part 1: 

I would take inspiration from The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence’s recommended panic and phobia application “FearFighter”. Although this application has 1.5 stars on the App store and no ratings on the play store. Despite the lack of user experience, FearFighter has proven clinically to reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression, and panic [9]. With this in mind, I can try to understand what the application was doing right to generate these positive results and by focusing on user experience, I can mitigate the downsides associated with this very low rating. 

I will also take inspiration on the recommended applications by the Anxiety and Depression Society of America. They have 2 applications which generally target anxiety but do have panic mitigation features. Although, these applications have not been shown clinically to have an impact on overall patient success and have some criticisms where they do not help with an acute attack.  

Finally, I can incorporate CBT activities with associated long-term improvement for panic treatment (such as interoceptive exposure). 

## For part 2: 

Cambridge found some examples of computerized therapy for depression and anxiety in 2018 that led to greater satisfaction with treatment long afterwards. They ran their study on the efficacy with the web application “Beating the Blues” which is an interactive CBT package and 8 therapy sessions lasting 50 minutes. The general way for how the program works can be found on their website as well as many papers published about the efficacy of this online treatment. Additionally, McGill recommends a selection of IOS and Android applications for targeting depression or anxiety.
