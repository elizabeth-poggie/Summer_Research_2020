### Issues 
- Ratings on the App Store
..* “This is a tool that is paid for with a government contract. They also portray that they are here to help employees. I downloaded the app on my iPad and it had some display issues in the first section. Then, after putting time aside to part two, it kept playing the SAME video over and over again. I gave up and went to their website to use the online version. At the place where it said, “Click to play”, it did nothing. What a bad joke to tell employees, “We’re here to help” and provide broken apps and a broken website.” Amdavis, 05/05/2020

..* “I’m stuck on a module and the app keeps quitting. I’ve deleted the app and logged out and logged back in, same problems. The content, as far as I have gotten, seems to be helpful, but the app function is terrible, which is why it’s a 1 Star review” aviboy97, 07/12/2019

..* “Useless The app crashes after watching the videos at 75% progression in Module 3. I cannot continue further, so I am uninstalling the app and seeking help elsewhere. What a huge waste of time.” CryoDrago, 05/31/2019

..* “VCS code provided by their website to access the app just pops up an error saying something went wrong, try again. The support on their website had no idea what the app was and recommended I look for a help option on their website - um, that’s how I contacted you in the first place? Their is also a web version of the app and that doesn’t even launch.” BenSS, 05/07/2019
