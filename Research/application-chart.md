# General CBT Notes

## Treatment options without medication for Panic [7]

### Context
- lasts about twelve sessions for most people
- some need more than twelve sessions due to other complicating factors such as depression

### Tasks
- relaxation training: progressive muscle relaxation, breathing training, creative visualization, and mindfulness practice. Studies have shown that over time, people who regularly engage in relaxation exercises are able to recover normal parasympathetic nervous system functioning (lack of functioning in this area is strongly associated with anxiety disorders). relaxation training is often the first intervention, as people often find they are better able to engage in the rest of the treatment more fully once they feel less muscle tension and tightness. 
- Cognitive Restructuring: designed to help people recognize and significantly alter thought patterns, as a way of shaking up the emotion system and reversing the course of depression and anxiety. begin with identifying automatic thoughts, those thoughts which provide a running commentary to our experience. Instead of accepting all of these thoughts as accurate reflections of reality, the cognitive therapist helps the patient to learn to think of these thoughts as guesses about what is really going on, and consider alternate points of view.
- Mindfulness: used to help teach people to experience unpleasant physical sensations without reacting negatively to them, thus short-circuiting the vicious cycle of fear and panic. (another way of focusing on panic self-efficacy and dealing with catastrophic beliefs ) most new scientific research looking into the numerous psychological benefits of mindfulness-based interventions. techniques focus on awareness of thoughts and feelings without attachment or judgment. When we are having intense emotions, it is often because we are caught up in our catastrophic interpretations about what is going on.
- Systematic Exposure treatment: Once people feel less anxious about future panic attacks due to using relaxation training, mindfulness, and cognitive restructuring, they are more able to confront anxiety-provoking situations. In panic disorder, patients are exposed to bodily sensations associated with panic attacks.

### Strengths
- relaxation training: decreased sleep problems, lowered blood pressure, reduced worry, and decreased impulsive behavior.

## Homework assignments in CBT [8]

### Context
- relative effectiveness of different types of homework assignments for different client problems.


### Strengths 
- this is used in fear fighter and Beating the blues.
- homework assignments facilitate improvement in therapy, and that homework compliance is confirmed as a significant predictor of therapy outcome. 

### Concluding observations
- homework produces significantly different effects for anxiety and depression samples
- groups receiving a range of homework activities produced larger effect sizes than groups receiving specific types of homework.
- homework type, source of homework compliance assessment, and time of homework compliance assessment are strong moderators of (a) homework effects and (b) the relationship between homework compliance and therapy outcome. 
- Doing homework might also indicate increased motivation to reach target goals for the patient.

# Panic CBT  

## Fear Fighter Project: A context-aware solution for treating acrophobia [4]

### Context 
- research study that focus on motivating and captivating qualities of the smart phone, useful to take into consideration when designing a comprehensive solution like the Fear Fighter Project 
- The basic element for CBT is to have the patient confront and remedy the irrational thought that provokes the anxiety, instead of avoiding it. 
- By increasingly being exposed to their fears and by applying the acquired techniques in the situation, it will gradually reduce the anxiety until the symptoms do no longer occur 
- target group who are people afflicted with a severe condition of acrophobia 

### Tasks 
- learn what the participants experience in certain situations and how they experience it.
- breathing, focusing and stepping exercises.
- Example of a focus activity that was effective: Patients are shown an array of randomly scattered colored dots. Subject must focus on the dots, counting each of the blue ones that would appear on the screen. 

### Strengths 
- Subjects saw online tasks as a distraction from the fear, and as a support.
- Most of the participants expressed that the reasons for this relaxing effect were clearly the sound of a calm voice.
- Game elements as a motivational factor.
- Some participants argued that it is nice to have a measure of your success. But success should not be measured in how many points you have achieved. 

### Issues
- Had to be certain motivating elements connected to the smart phone. No one is pushing you to be exposed to your vulnerabilities, it is completely up to you.

### Concluding observations 
- The play should not take over the goals and rules that are incorporated in the treatment process (where the elements assert as a motivational factor.)
- An important aspect of the FF treatment process is the relationship between the partial goals and greater promises
- You need to have something that is “playable” and “seductive”. Playability is important to give the users a sense of joy, drives motivation, reaching a goal, makes a user addicted to the application. Making the application more “seductive” will enhance playability. 
- in order to withhold subjects in a therapy program, it could be beneficial to integrate the following playability qualities in the design of the smart phone’s application, as ways of engaging the users in an emotional process: Challenge (challenge the users fear and panic like for example, gradually exposing the user to heights if they are afraid of heights), Curiosity, Control (control over the application, e.g. the length of the techniques or which techniques to use, and be able to stop if the anxiety level rises)
- By combining seductivity and playability, it is possible to create a relationship between the application and the user that is necessary for motivating the user to complete the treatment.
- creates hints and clues for the user and makes the application more understandable and meaningful
- In a situation where the users experience anxiety, emotions are controlling them. In these situations, it is important that the play elements are not visible. There should be a fine balance between the seriousness of the situation and the playability qualities.
- Besides the audible and visual qualities, the smart phone’s ability to portray game elements creates seductive and motivating reasons for the users to engage in the FF treatment.
- other aspects to include when investigating user experience, such as physical, sensual, cognitive, emotional and aesthetic
- Another finding that we have not mentioned was the wish for an online community, connected to the program. This opens up a new class of motivation, based on the social interactions. This reasoning is based on how the participants from this study felt that the smart phone in a longer therapeutic treatment without direct contact to a physical therapist cannot stand alone. 


## Efficacy in cognitive behavioral therapy for panic disorder [6]

### Context
- General idea: Understanding change processes in CBT for PD is important since it can lead to **prioritizing effective treatment components and methods, as well as augmenting treatment** for the still large group of non-responders
-  Catastrophic beliefs: Clark finds the most important factor to be the tendency to catastrophically misinterpret innocuous bodily symptoms or mental events (e.g. that a pounding heart may indicate a heart attack). This can lead to cycles of escalating anxiety leading to a panic attack. CBT for PD disconfirms the catastrophic beliefs and substitutes them with more realistic interpretations of the threatening stimuli, reducing the intensity of anxiety, and breaking the vicious cycle of panic attacks
- Self-Efficacy: Perceived ability to cope with or control panic attacks, panic self-efficacy, has also been proposed to play a key role in therapeutic change. Results provide some support for **panic self-efficacy as a mediator of outcome in CBT for Panic Disorder (PD), generally on par with catastrophic beliefs** (thinking about the worst-case scenario) in the reviewed studies
- Anxiety control theories stress the individual's perceived lack of control or inability to cope with anxiety-related bodily symptoms and anxiety-provoking situations as an important determinant for the development and maintenance of PD as well as anxiety disorders in general
- perceived self-efficacy may determine whether individuals will initiate appropriate coping behavior in a feared situation rather than safety behavior or avoidance, how hard they will try, and how long they will sustain their effort in the face of obstacles and aversive experiences such as anxiety. Thus, 
- **panic self-efficacy seems important for an individual's motivation and willingness to engage in challenging new behavior.**


### Tasks

- panic self-efficacy ( individual's belief in his or her capacity to execute behaviors) as a mediator of therapeutic change 

### Strengths and Issues

- some support was found for panic self-efficacy as a mediator of therapeutic change in CBT for PD, although none of the studies fulfilled all of the four criteria for mediation.

### Concluding observations 
- the study found strong support for CBT effectively improving panic self-efficacy,
- in therapy it may be important to increase the focus on building the individual's confidence in coping abilities, not only restricted to situation-specific actions, but also incorporate the individuals perceived ability to handle negative internal states such as bodily symptoms and scary thoughts.


## Efficacy of internet-based CBT for PD in psychiatric care [9]

### Context
- Guided Internet-based cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) for panic disorder could be highly effective when delivered in a clinical routine setting 
- Effect sizes were similar to those of conventional CBT 
- The treatment could be used to increase availability to effective psychological therapy for panic disorder
- Cohort study
- ICBT is a promising treatment option that could potentially be used to increase accessibility to evidence-based psychological treatment, it is of importance to investigate whether it is effective also when delivered in a routine care setting.
- ICBT is a promising treatment option that could potentially be used to increase accessibility to evidence-based psychological treatment, it is of importance to investigate whether it is effective also when delivered in a routine care setting.

### Measuring tools 

- Panic: The primary outcome measure was the Panic Disorder Severity Scale-Selfreport (PDSS-SR; 18).
- Depression: Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale-Self-report (MADRS-S; 19)

### Tasks
- essential components of ICBT for panic disorder are cognitive restructuring, behavioural experiments and exposure to feared situations and somatic sensations
- focus of attention, safety behaviours and agoraphobic avoidance as maintaining factors of panic disorder
- self-help programme comprises 10 text modules, each covering a specific theme such as interoceptive exposure or cognitive restructuring with associated homework assignments
- participants have access to an online discussion forum where they can communicate anonymously with each other.
- The expected duration of treatment is 10–12 weeks
- automatically reports signs of potential risk for dropout or symptom deterioration. For example, the treating psychologists are notified of patients who have not reported any homework for more than a week or have scored >3 on the suicide ideation item (number nine) of the MADRS-S.

Figure 1: Task Summary for the 10 week program used in the study 

<img src="./table.png"/>

### Strengths 
- The major clinical implication of this study is that ICBT for panic disorder can be implemented in a routine psychiatric context with effect sizes similar to those found in controlled trials
- ICBT strongly facilitates systematic collection of data making the treatment format optimal for health caregivers aiming at continuously evaluating treatments.
- at the ICBT unit, an estimate of the total time spent per treated patient would be less than 5 h. Compared with conventional CBT, which often requires 10–15 1-hour sessions plus time for preparation and administrative work, ICBT seems to be a way of using the therapist time very efficiently

### Issues
- complement to conventional psychological treatment and that all patients might not be suitable for or interested in receiving ICBT 

## Magellan FearFighter 

### Context

### Tasks

### Strengths 
- Recommended by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence’s (NICE)[1]
- Shown to be clinically significant [3]
- Helps with people in isolation. A study from Cambridge noted that “computer-guided CBT can play a useful part in delivering CBT services in rural areas; and that self-help CBT may be the only treatment option available to some sufferers.” [3]
- Available online, on IOS, and Android. 

### Issues 
- Ratings on the App Store
..* “This is a tool that is paid for with a government contract. They also portray that they are here to help employees. I downloaded the app on my iPad and it had some display issues in the first section. Then, after putting time aside to part two, it kept playing the SAME video over and over again. I gave up and went to their website to use the online version. At the place where it said, “Click to play”, it did nothing. What a bad joke to tell employees, “We’re here to help” and provide broken apps and a broken website.” Amdavis, 05/05/2020

..* “I’m stuck on a module and the app keeps quitting. I’ve deleted the app and logged out and logged back in, same problems. The content, as far as I have gotten, seems to be helpful, but the app function is terrible, which is why it’s a 1 Star review” aviboy97, 07/12/2019

..* “Useless The app crashes after watching the videos at 75% progression in Module 3. I cannot continue further, so I am uninstalling the app and seeking help elsewhere. What a huge waste of time.” CryoDrago, 05/31/2019

..* “VCS code provided by their website to access the app just pops up an error saying something went wrong, try again. The support on their website had no idea what the app was and recommended I look for a help option on their website - um, that’s how I contacted you in the first place? Their is also a web version of the app and that doesn’t even launch.” BenSS, 05/07/2019
- Costly, between 200 and 400 CAD[1]
- Requires a high-quality broadband connection since videos are being streamed to you directly[1]
- Since this is primarily video based, the activities in the app are not interactive (they do give 

### Concluding observations

# Anxiety Applications 

## Mindshift

### Tasks
- “Chill zone”: breathing, mindfulness exercise for noticing particular things in the environment, mindful breathing, 
- “healthy thinking”: mood journal to track feelings over time, belief journal where you state a situation and your feeling about the situation. It gives you a certain amount of time to see if this fear comes true. 
- “taking action”: building fear ladders, healthy habbits

### Strengths
- Recommended by the Anxiety and Depression Society of America 
- 4.2 rating on the Play Store and 4.3 on the App Store
- Makes CBT homework accessible and easy
- good display
- you can check in with how you are feeling at any moment. 
- the charts are helpful
- reading about symptoms of anxiety is helpful
- no adds. 
- free
- for some users during a panic attack someone can hardly see or move in the attack, but the navigation gets you to guided breathing exercises really fast. 

“i was just searching looking for an app to help me cope with my anxiety and this was the first one i saw. i opened it up once downloaded and was immediately pleased with the lay out and the display of the app. super easy and cute :) love it and would highly recommend.” -  stupidassrapeshit 2019
- Excellent mindfulness app. And it's free. Recommended for its variety and ease of use. – rocksandsocks 2019
- “. It also is great at helping me calm down when I need it, especially when I'm having an anxiety attack.” – ElpisX 2019
- “I love how you can check in with yourself and see how you’re feeling at the moment. That wasn’t something I used to do but I’m so glad I started doing it. It also helps with problems in my daily life and really improves me every day.” - Anyarmills, 2020

### Issues 
- Activities that they give the user are not interactive and are not helpful to acute attacks 
- Does not primarily target panic
- Not anonymous. Users feel uncomfortable with sharing how they are feeling and stresses them out further. 
- voices in the app are rushed and many reviews said they were creepy. 
- users want to track progress  
- limited in journal size. 400 characters is too constraining for many users. 
- once you select a challenge then you cannot delete it and only change it. Users feel forced to complete the task (which is not good. Users should be able to start and stop the task when they are feeling overwhelmed)
- check-ins for comorbid feelings associated with anxiety are not there. If you have a depressive episode, a user would want to record that. 
- some users find that its not helpful when a panic attack is coming. The app suggests the user to go out and face their fear for for some users the fear is permanent. 
- for some users the “submit journal” part is not working
- only a vertical interface (does not translate well to different screen dimensions)
- the breathing exercise just has the option of a voice with no text option nor animation. 
When I click the breathing exercise button it does not take me there right away. It requires a few tries
- not being able to access their anxiety summary. ************* (or symptom specific entries) the thing just gives you a view of your “overall mood”
- does not allow you to add more symptoms to the mood tracker. (ex depressive episodes etc)
- “ I wish it had some options in "check ins" for depressive episodes, since the co-morbidity with anxiety is very high. When a depressive episode ensues it tends to be less helpful for tracking in "check ins".” - 2020
- “Honestly I wasn’t expecting much but it’s a really good app for being free. My only issues is that the voices are lowkey a bit creepy in an unnatural way. I felt I couldn’t relax and they were fast paced as well. Other than that it’s really good.” – Katie 2019
- “I love this app, I use it as a personal mood journal. Only down fall is I wish it was easier to see how you’ve been overall the week. I only get it after I answered how I’m feeling. Over all 4/5 stars!” – maxxipie 2019
- Sadly, an account creation is now necessary. Yes it’s “free” but releasing this much personal information doesn’t feel right for an app which was initially designed to be easy, user-friendly and ready instantly. It’s seems generating data has taken priority over providing an amazing service. I will be looking for other options. - Gjg5 2019
- So far so good! I love the structure, especially for the thought journal. I was anxious even about starting CBT on my own without a resource to use to follow some kind of structure or plan, and this has provided exactly that! Drawbacks noted so far are; there is only enough space for 400 characters when writing, which honestly isn’t enough for a journal I feel. Also once you’ve selected a Challenge Your Comfort zone challenge, it is impossible to delete it, one can only change it. Then what? You have to complete it...I really like the home page, where you check in with an overview smiley - or frown - to indicate how your feeling, then select a level of anxiety and identify how it feels. Then continue to select reasons why you might be feeling those feelings. Then there’s many options to help deal like a Thought Journal, meditations and deep breathing, etc.” - Angel4Men 2019


It’s really handy for anyone who needs a little help, and doesn’t want to reach out to a person or can’t.


## Panic relief

### Context

- Offered by Psychiatrist, MD PhD Marianne Geoffroy
- Give the user 4 tasks to practice (square, arm, chest, body)

### Tasks

- Chest: recover normal breathing pattern. (avoid deep and frequent breathing during an attack / hyperventilation)
- Square: breath “in the square”. A common CBT measure. (gives visual and mental focus). Stay in mental control as your body calms down (this seems to be an example of panic self-efficacy)
- Arm: relaxation technique
- Body: visualization exercise
. transform panic into a more manageable sensation. 

### Strengths

- 4.6 stars on the app store, Although very few comments. 
- “The exercises are effective, and the app explains the panic process well. Most anti-anxiety help tools are very thought-orientated, where this app primarily addresses the physical aspects.” – Anna Dane 2016(this is focusing on panic self efficacy which has been shown to be an effective measure at combating panic)
- “I like how discrete the techniques are, making it possible to do them wherever i might be without drawing attention to myself. Simple and effective.” – KrisBGM 2013
- There are helpful animations that demonstrate how to do the tasks. 
- Sometimes panic can feel hot or cold. The app gives you the option to specify which of these feelings it is and reflect that in the animation. 

### Issues 

- 1.50 on the play store
- Relatively old app released in 2013
- Has no voice over and instead has written text to walk you through the steps. It has been suggested by a few studies that having a calming and reassuring voice to walk you through the steps is a key factor when it comes to panic applications. (redoing the application would require written text and a voice over)
- Some of the animations are choppy and you need to manually reset them if you wish to repeat the exercise. A better strategy would be to let them loop and have the option to stop at any point. 
- There is the option to skip the written text instructions and get right into the animation. AN issue with this is most people undergoing an attack can forget many minor steps necessary for the exercise. 
- The website that the app links you to is no longer in service. 


## Moodpath

### Tasks
- Main feature is a journal to track your feelings over time

### Strengths
- Voice to walk you through components of the app
-  However, I answered a question about suicide today (having had suicidal thoughts and depression most my life-but haven’t worries too much on actual actions-strictly thoughts). The app went straight into a message and continued with questions. Offering to call an anonymous help line, a text line, or to text a loved one. I clicked on the text a loved one option and it opened my texts with a text ready saying “Can you call me? I’m not doing well and I think I need to talk..” 

### Issues 
- To unlock the components that target panic and give you an overview of your progression, it is 40$
- No animation and no text options. (sometimes people do not have access to 
- Seems to crash and loose journal entries
- Logging of information is not stord locally on the application
- Cant control the times questions are sent to users
- The only things I would say is I wish the questions were less repetitive and generic... like they were basic depression/anxiety questions and depression/anxiety manifests itself in a variety of ways in different people & a lot of the questions repeated themselves over-and-over again and only sometimes id get a different question. Also on questions instead of just yes and no there should be a “Not applicable” option as well... for instance I’m young and there were questions such as “do you have a deceased sex drive?” And I’m not sexually active so it’s non applicable to me, but that wasn’t an option. Lastly I wish the results of the assessment took into account the severity of the symptoms themselves instead of just the number of symptoms. I feel like you can have a lot of depression symptoms but they might not be that severe or you can 1 or 2 and those happen to be bad symptoms
- emotions you can mark as how you feel, there is rarely emotions for what I’m feeling, insecure, selfish, the list goes on, and I don’t know about anyone else but my physical state has a large effect on my mood, being sore, or having a headache and so much more should be options to choose as either experiences or emotions, I’m somewhat shocked how that was overlooked
- I’m not happy to now have to pay for basic features like adding your own edited emotions to the list of ones to choose for each entry. 
-  it would be beneficial to provide exercises for individuals who have no prior experience with mindfulness.
- I gave 4 stars though mainly because I consistently lose my journaling if I get interrupted or distracted. It would be better if it kept it open for longer in a draft form.
-  it would be much easier if I were able to go back & edit a journal entry instead of making a new one if I think of something to add a few minutes later.
- Most of the time the questions at the beginning don’t apply to me most days. I’d like some sort of setting where you could go in and check like “i want to see these questions often” or “i want to see these questions rarely” based on what does/does not often apply.



## Calm
- mindfulness app for beginners

### Tasks
- Guided meditation sessions of different lengths 

### Strengths
- Guided mediations can be good as long as they are not guided by a creepy by a creepy voice

### Issues 
- lag
- 68 dollars per year
- Good app but it's frustrating that some of the recordings have only one voice. One of the guides has a sugary sweet voice which comes off as fake to me or even a little nutty (just my subjective opinion). I need someone who talks without so much artifice. The person I like isn't available on some of the recordings :( But I do love the app, just want to make this one gripe heard.


## Breathe2Relax

### Tasks
- Simple breathing exercises 

### Strengths
-  learning to breathe sounds trivial, but when you learn how to ,"the right way" this way, your whole life will change. with 2 minute cold showers , your going to see process rapidly in just days. Im always trying to find ways to feel better and this cold showers are now in my top.
-  The customization features are great. For a simple, guided mindfullness breathing tool this is the app to use.

### Issues 
- Inputting account information is impossible when having a panic attack
- Sometimes getting past the security screens is impossible even when a person is not panicking 
- I feel like the recordings were cheaply made due to the same words being repeated a lot and used very frequently. I also didn't like that they had to say something everytime I breathe in and out which distracted me from focusing on the breathing.
- why do you need access to my photos and personal data on my device. just to learn breathing exercises - what is wrong with this picture, i call it spying on peoples privacy. I don't need to say what come next- but go F yourself.
- Why do I now have to come up with a numeric password to stop my Panic Attack!
